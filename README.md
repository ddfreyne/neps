nanoc Enhancement Proposals
===========================

**DEPRECATED:** The NEPs are no longer used. Instead, the nanoc GitHub issue tracker is used, along with the [Trello board for nanoc 4.0](https://trello.com/board/nanoc-4-0/51671a676672ded155000027).

The nanoc enhancement proposals (NEPs) were meant to structure ideas for features, enhancements and changes in a more formal way.
