nanoc Enhancement Proposals
===========================

The nanoc enhancement proposals (NEPs) are meant to structure ideas for features, enhancements and changes in a more formal way. This repository contains all NEPs. The name "nanoc enhancement proposal" comes from Python's "Python Enhancement Proposal" (PEP).

The NEP process is still very new and very much in flux.
