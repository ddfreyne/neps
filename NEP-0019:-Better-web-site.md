The current web site is lacking in many aspects. A redesign should tackle the following issues:

* **Mobile support**: The current web site fails on mobile browsers. The new web site should use a responsive design that reflows to fit smaller screens.

* **Non-centralised documentation**: Documentation is currently spread out over the documentation section on the web site, the API documentation (which is the only place that houses the filter and helper documentation) and the commandline.

* **Showcase**: Quite a few large and well-known web sites now use nanoc. It would be a good idea to showcase these more. The homepage should certainly show some of them, and a separate showcase and perhaps a case study page would be useful.

* **Domain name**: The nanoc web site should not live at a subdomain of stoneship.org.

* **Logo**: nanoc needs a simple logo that can be used on business cards and stickers.

Domain name
-----------

The domain name **nanoc.ws** has been chosen to be the new home of nanoc. The “ws” could be interpreted as an abbreviation of “website”. This domain will not be used until the new web site is finished.

Documentation issues
--------------------

This probably deserves a NEP on its own. For the time being, see the Documentation page on the wishlist on the nanoc wiki.
